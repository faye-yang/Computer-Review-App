## Desktop Computer Components Review System

The web application showcases the best-selling and widely recommended desktop components based on data from commercial shopping websites as well as user-inputted reviews pertaining to each individual component item.

The purpose of the website is to recommend desktop components to the less-informed general public who find themselves uneased by the ostensibly daunting process of building their customized desktops and allow them to take note of reviews written by other users (who went ahead and purchased). This review system differs from those of commercial retail websites in that it isolates itself from any potential sources of bias like the retail companies themselves who may wish to push sales of more profitable items for their own benefit. The user can identify the best-selling desktop components within their specific category of interest (CPU, GPU, keyboards, etc) and make informed purchase decisions without substantial knowledge of computers. On a high level, a user may view the specific best-selling items, submit reviews of items that he or she purchased and has used, as well as read othersâ€™ reviews. User may also specify the category, which is reflected on the main page where items within that group is displayed.
